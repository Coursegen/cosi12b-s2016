title: Class Rules
---
Here are the norms expected from everyone in the classroom:

* You are required to bring your computer to class, and make sure that it's got enough charge to last. The computer should be set up to run Eclipse so we can do exercises together if and when needed.
* Most of the time I will ask that you have your computers  closed so you can focus on what's going on around you.
* I put a high value on participation, and I will ask questions a lot and I really hope that you will join in the fun!
