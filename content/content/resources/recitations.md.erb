title: Recitations
---

Once a week there are 1 hour recitations in the same classroom as the class is. Recitations are mandatory unless you've been officially excused. During recitations we will:

* review homework assignments and hand them out
* review homework solutions once they are handed in
* do problem solving sessions to reinforce what is covered in the lectures.
