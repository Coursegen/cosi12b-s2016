title: Academic Honesty
---

As stated in the Rights and Responsibilities handbook, "Every member of the University community is expected to maintain the highest standards of academic honesty. A student shall not receive credit for work that is not the product of the student's own effort."

Programming assignments must be completed individually (unless specified otherwise by the instructor:)

* all code you submit must be your own work. You may discuss general ideas of how to approach an assignment, but never specific details about the code to write.
* Any help you receive from or provide to classmates should be limited and should never involve details of how to code a solution.

As a student of this course you are agreeing to the following rules:

* You may not work as a partner with another student on an assignment.
* You may not get code from online sources.
* You may not show another student your solution to an assignment, nor look at his/her solution, for any reason.
* You may not have another person "walk you through" an assignment, describe in detail how to solve it, or sit with you as you write it. You also may not provide such help to another student. This includes current or former students, tutors, friends, TAs, web site forums, or anyone else.
* You may not post your homework solution code online or ask others for online help. This includes public message boards, forums, file sharing sites and services, or any other online system.
* Under our policy, a student who gives inappropriate help is equally guilty with one who receives it. Instead of providing such help to someone who does not understand an assignment, point him or her to other class resources such as lecture examples, the textbook, or emailing a TA or instructor.
* You must not share your solution and ideas with others. You must also ensure that your work is not copied by others, such as making sure to log out of shared computers, not leaving printouts of your code in public places, and not emailing your code to other students or posting it on the web. We enforce this policy by running similarity detection software over all submitted student programs.
