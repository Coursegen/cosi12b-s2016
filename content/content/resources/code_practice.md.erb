#### FAQ
* **What is this?** These are weekly two hour hackfests led by either a TA or a fellow student. They serve a single purpose, which is to give you a relaxed and supportive time exercise your coding. It's like going to the gym.
* **What happens?**** The leader of the session will pick out some coding challenges each time. The only rules are: program in Java and don't work on homework. This is meant to be learning from a different angle. There's no lecture or anything.
* **Who should come?** Any student who feels like leveling up his Java is encouraged to come. But, especially those of you who feel challenged or like you are not 'getting' someting or worried that you are falling behind. You should definitely make the time!
* **Can I come to more than one session?** Yes, if you must, it's fine. We're not really checking attendance or anything like that.
* **Where do I sign up?** The signup is on this google sheet: [ECP Signup Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/162r0bIrFlvJelDosCv2iBIJmU_2aw_jihIBp0lMqzL8/edit#gid=0)
* **What are expectations?** We (the TAs and other leaders) are taking time out to host these meetings, so please sign up, and please show up!
* **I want to be a leader, what should I do?** If you are a student in the class, but feel like you would like to try your hand at coming up with some problems and then hosting a meeting, by all means, send Pito and email and we'll get a room and materials for you!
* **Why are you doing this?** I know when I was learning to program I was looking for any way to practice my new skill and sharpen my craft. It was just too much fun. So I thought we should offer this to you all as well!
