title: Grades and Grading
---

The final grades for the course will be determined using the following weights:

##### Participation (25%)
Includes of course that you come to class on time and are engaged in the lecture. That you are responsive to questions and help with discussions and class activities. There may also be homeworks or in class activities which will be graded "participation only." For these you will receive an automatic 100 if you make a good faith effort, and a zero if you don't submit. However it will not matter how correct or incorrect your response is!

##### Programming: (50%)
There will be programming assignments roughtly evert week. Every program will be graded both on correctness and style/design. Homeworks are due on the day of class, by 8am. Submissions up to 24 hours late will be accepted but have a penalty. More than 24 hours late will not be accepted. Submissions that do not conform to the requested format exactly will not be accepted.

##### Exams: (25%)
There will be a tiny number of exams. The exams will have two parts. There will be a take-home part, which will ask you to design and implement a Java program. And there will be an in-class, closed book exam where you will be asked to write a mini-report about your solution by answering a series questions. Both the Java program and the mini-report will be graded.
