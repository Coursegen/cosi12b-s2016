title: Parts of a program
---
#### Intro
* All languages have a particular way write a program
* **Very particular!**
* A really simple program fits within a single file
* Almost all real programs take more than one file
* Each file is a building block, a component
* YOU the programmer decides what the job is of each file

#### Kinds of errors you will write
* Types
  * Syntax errors - error message from the "compiler", before it even runs
  * Logic errors - the program doesn't do what you expect
  * Crashes or exceptions - the program doesn't get anywhere
* Work on recognizing what kind of error you have
* **Take a 1/2 second to read the error message!!!**

#### "Hello World!"
<%= code_begin %>
public class Hello {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println(“Hello World.”);

	}
}
<%= code_end %>
#### Facts about java programs
* Yes, this is a valid Java program
* But to run it you have to put it into a text file
* File is called the same as the class, hello.java
* Java"source code"
  * Usually spaces don't matter
  * Usually extra lines don't matter
  * Everything is case sensitive. All these are different!
    * int myRecord;
    * int Myrecord;
    * int myrecord;
    * Int myrecord; **wrong!!**

#### Template for a Java program

<%= code_begin %>
public class <name> {
  public void method1(<arguments>) {
    <statement>;
    <statement>;
    ...
    <statement>;
  }
  public void method2(<args>) {
    <statement>;
    ...
  }
  ...
}

<%= code_end %>

* Whats a statement? A line of java, e.g. for ..., return ... etc.
* Note use of \<name\>: where you put a name, etc.

#### What's a method?
* A method is just a named set of statements
* Instead of copying the lines you create a sub-routine
* What happens when a method is called?
  * Exection "jumps" into that method
  * Executes the statements of that method
  * "Jumps" back to the opoint where the message was called

#### What's a class?
* A named collection of methods and fields
* A "blueprint" to createa a new Object

#### Variables and types

<%= code_begin %>
public class Hello {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    int weeksPerYear;
    int daysPerWeek;
    weeksPerYear = 52;
    daysPerWeek = 7
    int daysPerYear;
    daysPeryear = weeksPerYear * daysPerWeek;
    System.out.println(daysPerYear);
  }
}
<%= code_end %>
