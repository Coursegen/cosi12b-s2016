#### What this course is about
* Going to the next level in Programming
* Learning more advanced programming concepts
* Also learning more advaned techniques

##### What's it really like to be a programmer?
* It's a highly creative activity
* It's not like mathematics
* It's about design
* It's about being a detective
* It's about being a researcher
* It's magic!

#### About the course

* Pito Salas (that's me)
* Ryan Marcus (lead TA)
* Other TAs

##### Concepts we will cover
* Review of CS11a
* Overall program structure
* Object Oriented Programming
* Errors, exceptions, control flow
* Different kinds of Arrays
* Different kinds of Hashes

##### Techniques we will cover
* Keeping it simple
* Using Eclipse to experiment and program
* Practicing decomposition
* Debugging techniques

#### Programming Languages
* Programming languages are more similar than different!
* You write a program as a text file
* That text file instructs the computer how to behave

##### Why Java?
* A very common programming language and environment
* From tiny devices to huge clusters of computers
* Fantastic tools and libraries

##### Tools
* Command-line tools
* Text editor: Atom
* IDE: Eclipse
* Demonstration

##### Programming or Software Engineering?
* Requirement: Start with a crystal clear requirement
  * Ask questions to eliminate all ambiguity
* Decomposition: Break the problem apart
  * Does it go through stages?
  * What outputs are required?
  * What information is needed at each stage?
* Design: Figure out the building blocks
  * Data structures
  * Data types
  * Variables
  * Classes
* Implementation
  * Actually write the java program
  * Step by step
* Debugging
  * It never works the first time
  * Try to understand it by examining it
  * Print intermediate results
  * Single step
