title: Building blocks -  Statements
---
#### Statments
* Basic "molecules" of a program (or atoms or whatever)
* Individual steps of a program that do something
* Usually "executed" one after the other
  * Unless: conditionals, loops, method calls

#### Statements that don't change flow
* declarations, e.g. `int a;`
* assignments, e.g. `a = 100;`

#### Statements that change flow
* method calls, e.g. `System.out.println("Hello");`
* conditionals, e.g. `if a==1 ... etc`
* iterations, e.g. `for (i=0; i < 10; i++) ...etc`

#### Variables
* A variable is like a box that will hold a value
* Different boxes have different shapes
* Can't put a car into a shoebox!
* So we have to **declare** variables and indicate the "size"
* Variables always have a **name** and a **datatype**

#### Datatypes
