title: Building blocks -  Statements
desc: Statements are the molecular building blocks of programs
---
#### Statments
* Basic "molecules" of a program (or atoms or whatever)
* Individual steps of a program that do something
* Usually "executed" one after the other
  * Unless: conditionals, loops, method calls

#### Statements that don't change flow
* declarations, e.g. `int a;`
* assignments, e.g. `a = 100;`

#### Statements that change flow
* method calls, e.g. `System.out.println("Hello");`
* conditionals, e.g. `if a==1 ... etc`
* iterations, e.g. `for (i=0; i < 10; i++) ...etc`
